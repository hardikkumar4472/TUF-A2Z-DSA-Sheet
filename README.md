# 47 Days of Striver A2Z DSA Sheet

This repository contains my solutions for the **Striver A2Z DSA Sheet** over a period of **47 consecutive days**. The goal of this project is to consistently solve a curated set of problems covering all fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** topics. The sheet is designed to provide a structured approach for mastering DSA, and I solved each problem in **C++** while analyzing the time and space complexities of my solutions.

## Overview

- **Duration**: 47 Days (Consistent Daily Problem Solving)
- **Goal**: Solve problems from the Striver A2Z DSA Sheet to build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms.
- **Language**: C++
- **Difficulty Level**: The problems cover a range of difficulty levels, from beginner to advanced.
- **Platform**: The problems are solved using **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and other online platforms.

## Topics Covered

The Striver A2Z DSA Sheet covers a wide variety of topics in DSA:

1. **Arrays**:  
   - Sorting, searching, sliding window, etc.
   - Rotations, subarrays, and sub-sequences.
   
2. **Strings**:  
   - String matching, anagrams, and manipulation problems.
   
3. **Linked Lists**:  
   - Reversing lists, cycle detection, and merging.
   
4. **Stacks and Queues**:  
   - Implementations, balanced parentheses, and other real-world applications.

5. **Trees**:  
   - Binary trees, binary search trees, tree traversals, and problems like Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA).
   
6. **Graphs**:  
   - Depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and shortest path problems.
   
7. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**:  
   - Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, and more complex DP problems.
   
8. **Backtracking**:  
   - N-Queens problem, permutations, subsets, and combinations.

9. **Greedy Algorithms**:  
   - Activity selection, coin change, and interval problems.
   
10. **Bit Manipulation**:  
    - XOR, bit masking, and optimization problems.
